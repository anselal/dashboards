Hello coder,

If you plan to build your next **admin dashboard** using the Bootstrap Framework, this list with open-source templates might help you a little bit.
All **open-source admin panels** listed in this article are suitable for hobby and commercial products and are actively supported by the publishers.

> For more free **dashboards**, please access **[Admin Dashboards - Open-Source and Free](https://dev.to/sm0ke/admin-dashboards-open-source-and-free-4aep)** a popular article published on Dev.to platform. Thank you!

## Dashboard selection criteria

- Permissive license: [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), [Apache License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License)
- Modern Design
- The product is actively supported
- Minimum tooling (gulp, webpack, parcel)

### Motivation to write this article

The existing `Top 20+ Admin Dashboards` articles, most of them, are written by publishers with this bad habit of sniffing a lot of commercial apps in the content, without mention this aspect in the title.

I’m not saying this is good or bad, but is not obvious if the apps are free or not, just by reading the title. **Well, this is not the case here**. Let's go!
